                Preface
              </h3>
              <p>
                “Don’t be evil.” Googlers generally apply those words to how we serve our users.
                But “Don’t be evil” is much more than that. Yes, it’s about providing our users
                unbiased access to information, focusing on their needs and giving them the best
                products and services that we can. But it’s also about doing the right thing more
                generally – following the law, acting honorably, and treating co-workers with
                courtesy and respect.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Google Code of Conduct is one of the ways we put “Don’t be evil” into practice.
                It’s built around the recognition that everything we do in connection with our work
                at Google will be, and should be, measured against the highest possible standards
                of ethical business conduct. We set the bar that high for practical as well as
                aspirational reasons: Our commitment to the highest standards helps us hire great
                people, build great products, and attract loyal users. Trust and mutual respect
                among employees and users are the foundation of our success, and they are something
                we need to earn every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                So please do read the Code, and follow both its spirit and letter, always bearing
                in mind that each of us has a personal responsibility to incorporate, and to
                encourage other Googlers to incorporate, the principles of the Code into our work.
                And if you have a question or ever think that one of your fellow Googlers or the
                company as a whole may be falling short of our commitment, don’t be silent. We want
                – and need – to hear from you.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Who Must Follow Our Code?
              </h3>
              <p>
                We expect all of our employees and Board members to know and follow the Code.
                Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, including termination of
                employment. Moreover, while the Code is specifically written for Google employees
                and Board members, we expect Google contractors, consultants, and others who may be
                temporarily assigned to perform work or services for Google to follow the Code in
                connection with their work for us. Failure of a Google contractor, consultant, or
                other covered service provider to follow the Code can result in termination of
                their relationship with Google.
              </p>
              <h3>
                What If I Have a Code-Related Question or Concern?
              </h3>
              <p>
                If you have a question or concern, don’t just sit there. You can contact your
                manager, your Human Resources representative, or Ethics & Compliance. You can also
                submit a question or raise a concern of a suspected violation of our Code or any
                other Google policy through the Ethics & Compliance Helpline. Finally, if you
                believe a violation of law has occurred, you can always raise that through the
                Ethics & Compliance helpline or with a government agency.
              </p>

                No Retaliation
              </h3>
              <p>
                Google prohibits retaliation against any worker here at Google who reports or
                participates in an investigation of a possible violation of our Code, policies, or
                the law. If you believe you are being retaliated against, please contact Ethics &
                Compliance.

              <p>
                Our users value Google not only because we deliver great products and services, but
                because we hold ourselves to a higher standard in how we treat users and operate
                more generally. Keeping the following principles in mind will help us to maintain
                that high standard:

                    Our reputation as a company that our users can trust is our most valuable
                    asset, and it is up to all of us to make sure that we continually earn that
                    trust. All of our communications and other interactions with our users should
                    increase their trust in us.

                    Our products, features, and services should make Google more useful for all our
                    users. We have many different types of users, from individuals to large
                    businesses, but one guiding principle: “Is what we are offering useful?”

                  <p>
                    Always remember that we are asking users to trust us with their personal
                    information. Preserving that trust requires that each of us respect and protect
                    the privacy and security of that information. Our security procedures strictly
                    limit access to and use of users’ personal information, and require that each
                    of us take measures to protect user data from unauthorized access. Know your
                    responsibilities under these procedures, and collect, use, and access user
                    personal information only as authorized by our Security Policies, our Privacy
                    Policies, and applicable data protection laws.

                    Google is committed to advancing privacy and freedom of expression for our
                    users around the world. Where user privacy and freedom of expression face
                    government challenges, we seek to implement internationally recognized
                    standards that respect those rights as we develop products, do business in
                    diverse markets, and respond to government requests to access user information
                    or remove user content. Contact Legal or Ethics & Compliance if you have
                    questions on implementing these standards in connection with what you do at
                    Google.

                    responding to communications from our users, whether questions, problems, or
                    compliments. If something is broken, fix it.

                    take the initiative to step forward when the interests of our users are at
                    stake.

                    encourage you to immediately report the incident to your supervisor, Human
                    Resources or both. Similarly, supervisors and managers who learn of any such

                    Our position on substance abuse is simple: It is incompatible with the health
                    and safety of our employees, and we don’t permit it. Consumption of alcohol is
                    not banned at our offices, but use good judgment and never drink in a way that
                    leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety
                    of others, or violates the law. Illegal drugs in our offices or at sponsored
                    events are strictly prohibited. If a manager has reasonable suspicion to
                    believe that an employee’s use of drugs and/or alcohol may adversely affect the
                    employee’s job performance or the safety of the employee or others in the
                    workplace, the manager may request an alcohol and/or drug screening. A
                    reasonable suspicion may be based on objective symptoms such as the employee’s
                    appearance, behavior, or speech.

                III. Avoid Conflicts of Interest
              </h3>
              <p>
                When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue
                a personal benefit for you, your friends, or your family at the expense of Google
                or our users, you may be faced with a conflict of interest. All of us should avoid
                conflicts of interest and circumstances that reasonably present the appearance of a
                conflict.
              </p>
              <p>
                When considering a course of action, ask yourself whether the action you’re
                considering could create an incentive for you, or appear to others to create an
                incentive for you, to benefit yourself, your friends or family, or an associated
                business at the expense of Google.If the answer is “yes,” the action you’re
                considering is likely to create a conflict of interest situation, and you should
                avoid it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Below, we provide guidance in seven areas where conflicts of interest often arise:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Personal investments
                </li>
                <li>Outside employment, advisory roles, board seats, and starting your own business
                </li>
                <li>Business opportunities found through work
                </li>
                <li>Inventions
                </li>
                <li>Friends and relatives; co-worker relationships
                </li>
                <li>Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies
                </li>
                <li>Use of Google products and services
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In each of these situations, the rule is the same – if you are considering entering
                into a business situation that creates a conflict of interest, don’t. If you are in
                a business situation that may create a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a
                conflict of interest, review the situation with your manager and Ethics &
                Compliance. Finally, it’s important to understand that as circumstances change, a
                situation that previously didn’t present a conflict of interest may present one.

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Avoid making personal investments in companies that are Google competitors or
                    business partners when the investment might cause, or appear to cause, you to
                    act in a way that could harm Google.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When determining whether a personal investment creates a conflict of interest,
                    consider the relationship between the business of the outside company, Google’s
                    business, and what you do at Google, including whether the company has a
                    business relationship with Google that you can influence, and the extent to
                    which the company competes with Google. You should also consider 1) any overlap
                    between your specific role at Google and the company’s business, 2) the
                    significance of the investment, including the size of the investment in
                    relation to your net worth, 3) whether the investment is in a public or private
                    company, 4) your ownership percentage of the company, and 5) the extent to
                    which the investment gives you the ability to manage and control the company.

                    Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Google
                    competitors or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear

                    seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky
                    from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before
                    accepting a board seat with any outside company. Google board members and
                    employees who are VP and above should also notify Ethics & Compliance. Finally,
                    do not start your own business if it will compete with Google.

                    Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies from a Google
                    competitor or business partner can easily create the appearance of a conflict

                    Non-Government Related Gifts & Client Entertainment Policy provides specific
                    guidance on when it is appropriate for Googlers to accept gifts, entertainment,
                    or any other business courtesy (including discounts or benefits that are not
                    made available to all Googlers) from any of our competitors or business

                    Generally, acceptance of inexpensive “token” non-cash gifts is permissible. In
                    addition, infrequent and moderate business meals and entertainment with clients
                    and infrequent invitations to attend local sporting events and celebratory
                    meals with clients can be appropriate aspects of many Google business
                    relationships, provided that they aren’t excessive and don’t create the
                    appearance of impropriety. Before accepting any gift or courtesy, consult the
                    Non-Government Related Gifts & Client Entertainment Policy, and be aware that
                    you may need to obtain manager approval.

                    Avoiding potential conflicts of interest also means that you should not use

                    never approve Google accounts, services, or credits for yourself, your friends,

                    Make sure that information that is classified as “Need to Know” or
                    “Confidential” in Google’s Data Classification Guidelines is handled in
                    accordance with those Guidelines and Google’s Data Security Policy. At times, a
                    particular project or negotiation may require you to disclose Need to Know or
                    Confidential information to an outside party: Disclosure of that information
                    should be on an “only as needed” basis and only under a non-disclosure
                    agreement. In addition, Google policy may require a prior security assessment
                    of the outside party that is to receive the confidential information. Be sure
                    to conduct the appropriate due diligence and have the appropriate agreement in

                    There are, of course, “gray areas” in which you will need to apply your best
                    judgment in making sure you don’t disclose any confidential information.
                    Suppose a friend who works at a non-profit organization asks you informally how
                    to improve the Google search ranking of the group’s website: Giving your friend
                    site-optimization tips available in public articles and on websites isn’t
                    likely to be a problem, but giving tips that aren’t publicly known definitely
                    would be. If you’re in a gray area, be cautious in what advice or insight you
                    provide or, better yet, ask for guidance from Ethics & Compliance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And don’t forget about pictures you and your guests take at Google – it is up
                    to you to be sure that those pictures don’t disclose confidential information.

                Financial integrity and fiscal responsibility are core aspects of corporate
                professionalism. This is more than accurate reporting of our financials, though
                that’s certainly important. The money we spend on behalf of Google is not ours;
                it’s the company’s and, ultimately, our shareholders’. Each person at Google – not
                just those in Finance – has a role in making sure that money is appropriately
                spent, our financial records are complete and accurate, and internal controls are
                honored. This matters every time we hire a new vendor, expense something to Google,
                sign a new business contract, or enter into any deals on Google’s behalf.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make sure that we get this right, Google maintains a system of internal controls
                to reinforce our compliance with legal, accounting, tax, and other regulatory
                requirements in every location in which we operate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stay in full compliance with our system of internal controls, and don’t hesitate to
                contact Ethics & Compliance or Finance if you have any questions. What follows are
                some core concepts that lie at the foundation of financial integrity and fiscal
                responsibility here at Google.

                  <p>
                    A core Google value has always been to spend money wisely. When you submit an
                    expense for reimbursement or spend money on Google’s behalf, make sure that the
                    cost is reasonable, directly related to company business, and supported by
                    appropriate documentation. Always record the business purpose (e.g., if you
                    take someone out to dinner on Google, always record in our expense
                    reimbursement tool the full names and titles of the people who attended as well
                    as the reason for the dinner) and comply with other submission requirements. If
                    you’re uncertain about whether you should spend money or submit an expense for
                    reimbursement, check with your manager. Managers are responsible for all money
                    spent and expenses incurred by their direct reports, and should carefully
                    review such spend and expenses before approving.

                    Each time you enter into a business transaction on Google’s behalf, there

                    sign any contract on behalf of Google unless all of the following are met:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You are authorized to do so under our Signature Authority and Approval
                    Policy. If you are unsure whether you are authorized, ask your manager
                    </li>
                    <li>The contract has been approved by Legal. If you are using an approved
                    Google form contract, you don’t need further Legal approval unless you have
                    made changes to the form contract or are using it for other than its intended
                    purpose
                    </li>
                    <li>You have studied the contract, understood its terms and decided that

                    All contracts at Google should be in writing and should contain all of the

                    As Google grows, we enter into more and more deals with suppliers of equipment

                    This almost always requires that you solicit competing bids to make sure that

                    It’s important that we keep records for an appropriate length of time. The

                    legal requirements, accounting rules, and other external sources sometimes
                    specify longer retention periods for certain types of records, and those
                    control where applicable. In addition, if asked by Legal to retain records
                    relevant to a litigation, audit, or investigation, do so until Legal tells you

                    U.S. and international trade laws control where Google can send or receive its

                    <li>exposing or allowing access by non-U.S. persons to U.S. technical data can
                    be an “export”, regardless of what country the exposure occurred in

                    <li>sending a server from one country (“country X”) into another country

                    Competition Laws
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Most countries have laws – known as “antitrust,” “competition,” or “unfair
                    competition” laws – designed to promote free and fair competition. Generally
                    speaking, these laws prohibit 1) arrangements with competitors that restrain
                    trade in some way, 2) abuse of intellectual property rights, and 3) use of
                    market power to unfairly disadvantage competitors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Certain conduct is absolutely prohibited under these laws, and could result in
                    your imprisonment, not to mention severe penalties for Google.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Examples of prohibited conduct include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>agreeing with competitors about prices
                    </li>
                    <li>agreeing with competitors to rig bids or to allocate customers or markets
                    </li>
                    <li>agreeing with competitors to boycott a supplier or customer
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Other activities can also be illegal, unfair, or create the appearance of
                    impropriety. Such activities include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>sharing competitively sensitive information (e.g., prices, costs, market
                    distribution, etc.) with competitors
                    </li>
                    <li>entering into a business arrangement or pursuing a strategy with the sole
                    purpose of harming a competitor
                    </li>
                    <li>using Google’s size or strength to gain an unfair competitive advantage
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Although the spirit of these laws is straightforward, their application to
                    particular situations can be quite complex.
                  </p>

                    apply to you. Any personnel found to have violated Google’s Antitrust Policies
                    will, subject to local laws, be disciplined, up to and including termination of
                    employment. If you suspect that anyone at the company is violating the

                    Insider Trading Laws
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    As we said earlier, internally we share information, including non-public
                    information, about Google’s business operations pretty freely (think of TGIF).
                    In addition, you may overhear a hallway conversation or come across a memo at a
                    copy machine, either of which might involve confidential information. To use
                    this non-public information to buy or sell stock, or to pass it along to others
                    so that they may do so, could constitute insider trading. Insider trading not
                    only violates this Code, it violates the law. Don’t do it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You should familiarize yourself with Google’s Insider Trading Policy. It
                    describes company-wide policies that address the risks of insider trading, such
                    as a prohibition on any Google employee hedging Google stock; and periodic
                    blackout windows when no Google employee may trade Google stock.

                  <p>
                    Like all businesses, Google is subject to lots of laws, both U.S. and non-U.S.,
                    that prohibit bribery in virtually every kind of commercial setting. The rule
                    for us at Google is simple – don’t bribe anybody, anytime, for any reason.

                  <p>
                    You should be careful when you give gifts and pay for meals, entertainment, or
                    other business courtesies on behalf of Google. We want to avoid the possibility
                    that the gift, entertainment, or other business courtesy could be perceived as
                    a bribe, so it’s always best to provide such business courtesies infrequently
                    and, when we do, to keep their value moderate. Consult Google’s Non-Government
                    Related Gifts and Client Entertainment Policy before providing any business
                    courtesies and contact Ethics & Compliance if you have any questions.

                    Dealing with government officials
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Offering gifts, entertainment, or other business courtesies that could be
                    perceived as bribes becomes especially problematic if you’re dealing with a
                    government official. “Government officials” include any government employee;
                    candidate for public office; or employee of government-owned or -controlled
                    companies, public international organizations, or political parties. Several
                    laws around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the
                    UK Bribery Act, specifically prohibit offering or giving anything of value to
                    government officials to influence official action or to secure an improper
                    advantage. This not only includes traditional gifts, but also things like
                    meals, travel, political or charitable contributions, and job offers for
                    government officials’ relatives. Never give gifts to thank government officials
                    for doing their jobs. By contrast, it can be permissible to make infrequent and
                    moderate expenditures for gifts and business entertainment for government
                    officials that are directly tied to promoting our products or services (e.g.,
                    providing a modest meal at a day-long demonstration of Google products).
                    Payment of such expenses can be acceptable (assuming they are permitted under
                    local law) but may require pre-approval from Ethics & Compliance under Google’s
                    Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics Policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The U.S. also has strict rules that severely limit the ability of a company or
                    its employees to give gifts and business courtesies to a U.S. government
                    official and also limit the official’s ability to accept such gifts. The Honest
                    Leadership and Open Government Act prohibits giving any gifts, including travel
                    and other courtesies, to Members, Officers, and employees of the U.S. Senate
                    and House of Representatives unless they fit within one of a number of specific
                    exceptions. Gifts to employees of the U.S. executive branch are also regulated
                    and subject to limits. Finally, state and local government officials in the
                    U.S. are also subject to additional legal restrictions. Consult Google’s
                    Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics Policy before giving any such gifts or
                    business courtesies and obtain all required pre-approvals. In sum, before
                    offering any gifts or business courtesies to a U.S. or other government
                    official, you should consult Google’s Anti-Bribery and Government Ethics
                    Policy. Carefully follow the limits and prohibitions described there, and
                    obtain any required pre-approvals. If after consulting the Policy you aren’t
                    sure what to do, ask Ethics & Compliance.

                VIII. Conclusion
              </h3>
              <p>
                Google aspires to be a different kind of company. It’s impossible to spell out
                every possible ethical scenario we might face. Instead, we rely on one another’s
                good judgment to uphold a high standard of integrity for ourselves and our company.
                We expect all Googlers to be guided by both the letter and the spirit of this Code.
                Sometimes, identifying the right thing to do isn’t an easy call. If you aren’t
                sure, don’t be afraid to ask questions of your manager, Legal or Ethics &
                Compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
                And remember… don’t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn’t right –
                speak up!
